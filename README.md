🧪 *QA Analyst Jr | Software Quality Enthusiast*  
🎓 Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development  
💻 Background as Front-end Developer

I am a QA Analyst Jr with hands-on experience in *manual testing*, working closely with development teams to ensure software quality, reliability, and usability.

I have participated in testing critical systems and digital products, validating business rules, edge cases, and regression scenarios, always focusing on delivering safe and consistent user experiences.

My background as a developer helps me communicate effectively with engineers, understand system behavior, analyze logs, and anticipate potential failure points.

### 🔍 What I work with
- Manual testing (test cases, exploratory testing, regression)
- Agile methodologies (Scrum)
- Git and version control
- Change Management (GMUD)
- Validation of critical flows and business rules
- Collaboration with product and development teams

---

### 🚀 Currently evolving in
- Test automation with **Cypress**
- Automated test structure and best practices
- Test execution using **Docker**
- API testing fundamentals

This GitHub is focused on my journey in *Software Quality*, where I document studies, practices, and test projects as part of my continuous learning process.
